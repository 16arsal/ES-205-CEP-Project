Project Overview:

This project explores the application of linear regression and matrix factorization techniques on S&P 500 data. Our goal is to analyze stock market trends and identify potential investment opportunities.

Data:

We are using historical data from the S&P 500 index and individual stock constituents.
The data includes features such as opening price, closing price, high price, low price, volume, and dividend yield.
Methodology:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Cleaning and processing the S&P 500 data to address missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Feature engineering: creating new features that may be relevant for prediction.
Linear Regression:
Building a linear regression model to predict the closing price of a specific stock based on other features.
We are evaluating the model performance using metrics such as R-squared and mean-squared error.
Matrix Factorization:
Applying matrix factorization techniques like Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to uncover hidden patterns and relationships within the stock data.
Analyzing the identified factors and interpreting their meaning in the context of the stock market.
Investment Analysis:
The insights gained from linear regression and matrix factorization are used to identify potential investment opportunities based on predicted stock performance.
Software Tools:

Python libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
Visualization tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Project Deliverables:

A comprehensive report detailing the project methodology, data analysis, model results, and investment insights.
Python code implements data cleaning, linear regression, matrix factorization, and visualization components.
Presentation slides summarizing the project findings and key takeaways.
Project Schedule:


Expected Outcomes:

Develop a robust linear regression model for predicting stock closing prices.
Identify key factors driving the stock market using matrix factorization techniques.
Generate valuable insights for potential investment opportunities.
Gain practical experience applying advanced linear algebra concepts to real-world problems.
Further Developments:

Incorporating additional machine learning algorithms for improved accuracy.
Analyzing the impact of macroeconomic factors on stock prices.
Developing a web application for investors to utilize the insights generated from this project.
